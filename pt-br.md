# Salmos Agnósticos para GenZ 🖤
*Para quem questiona tudo*

## Salmo 1: O Algoritmo 📱
*Wednesday's Version*

Blessed é quem não segue trends tóxicos 🚫
Não fica no drama dos comments 💬
Nem senta com influencers fake ❌

Mas curte sabedoria que bate diferente 🧠
Questionando verdades day & night 🌙
É como árvore que cresce sozinha—
Conteúdo nunca flopa 📈
Growth orgânico sempre 🌱

Os superficiais? 
Chaff no vento 💨
Não passam no reality check ✅

Existe algo maior que conhece os autênticos?
Energia falsa sempre se expõe 👻

## Salmo 23: Provider Desconhecido 🤷‍♀️
*Versão Cética*

Algo me sustenta, não sei o quê 🤔
Me deixa rest na grama boa 🍃
Águas calmas somehow aparecem 💧
Soul gets recharged—how? 🔋

Paths certos se abrem
Por razões unknown 🛤️

Even walking through dark valleys 🌑
Não tenho medo total
Something's there comigo 👤
Protection exists, fonte unclear 🛡️

Mesa aparece na frente dos haters 🍽️
Abundance flows mysteriously 🌊
Cup overflowing, origem? 🥤

Love & goodness me seguem
All my days somehow 📅
Universe's house é meu forever home? 🏠

## Salmo 42: Existential Crisis 🖤
*Para Mentes Questionadoras*

Como deer precisa de água 🦌
Soul thirsts for... something greater? 💭
When will I feel that connection again? 🔌

Tears = my food 😭
Day & night endless
People asking: "Where's your faith?" 

Remember quando eu sentia... peace? ☮️
That joy que batia different 
Now just void & questions ❓

Why so depressed brain? 🧠💔
Why chaos mental sempre?
Maybe hope in... possibilities? 🌅
Will praise the mystery again

Soul pressed dentro de mim 
Remember... something from somewhere 📍
Deep calls to deep 🌊
Waves crash over me
All frequencies at once 📻

Day shows... love? Morning songs? 🎵
Night prayers to unknown forces 🌌

Why so down? 🔻
Why restless soul sempre?
Hope in cosmic uncertainty 🌌
Praise the inexplicable 🙌

## Salmo 51: Accountability Post 📝
*After Getting Exposed*

Mercy from... whatever judges me 🤷‍♀️
According to universal love laws? 💖
Delete my fuck-ups completely 🗑️
Wash away wrongdoing patterns 🧼

I acknowledge my failures 📋
Always haunting me 👻
Against cosmic order I messed up
Wrong by universal standards ⚖️

Problematic since birth confirmed 👶
Flawed desde conception maybe

Truth wanted in inner self 🔍
Wisdom taught in heart space ❤️
Cleanse me → clean result 🧽
Wash me → pure outcome 🤍

Let me hear joy again 📢
Broken bones rejoice somehow 🦴
Hide face from mistakes 🙈
Erase wrongdoing history 📖❌

Create clean heart em mim 💚
Renew right spirit within ✨
Don't banish from presence 🚪
Don't remove inspiring force 💨

Return salvation joy? 😊
Sustain with willing spirit 
Then teach others ways 🎓
They'll return to source também

## Salmo 121: Mountain Energy ⛰️
*Elevation Vibes*

I look up mountains— 👀
Where help comes from? 🤔
Help comes from... 
Whatever made heaven & earth? 🌍

It won't let you fall— 🪂
Your protector never sleeps 😴❌
Whatever watches over
Never takes breaks 24/7 ⏰

The Force watches você 👁️
Shade at your right hand 🤚
Sun won't harm by day ☀️
Moon won't hurt at night 🌙

Protection from all harm 🛡️
Life-watching continues 👀
Coming & going covered 🚪
Now & forever somehow ♾️

Period. That's it. 💯

## Salmo 139: Seen & Known 👁️
*Quando o Universo Hits Different*

Something searched me deep 🔍
Knows me completely somehow 🤯
Knows my sitting & standing 🪑
Understands thoughts from distance 📡

Observes my path & rest 👣
Familiar with all my ways 🗺️
Before words on tongue 👅
Already known by... what? 🤷‍♀️

Hemmed in behind & before 📦
Hand placed upon me 🤲
Knowledge too amazing— 🤯
Beyond comprehension level 

Where escape from Spirit? 🏃‍♀️
Where run from presence? 🏃‍♂️
Heaven → there 👆
Depths → there também 👇

Wings of dawn taken 🕊️
Far side of sea settled 🌊
Even there guidance exists 🧭
Right hand holds me fast 🤝

Darkness tries hiding me 🫥
Light becomes night around 🌃
Even darkness isn't dark to... It? 🌌
Night shines like day
Darkness & light = same 💡

Created innermost being 🧬
Knit together in womb 🤰
Fearfully & wonderfully made 😌
Works are wonderful confirmed ✨

Search me, Unknown Force 🔎
Know my heart completely ❤️
Test anxious thoughts 🧠
See offensive ways 👀
Lead in eternal path 🛤️

Something really sees me. 
That's everything. 💫
